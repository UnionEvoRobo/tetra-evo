STLA_IO_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Test the routines in the STLA_IO library.

TEST01
  STLA_CHECK makes some simple checks on a file.

  The file "cube.stla" seems to be a legal ASCII STL file.

TEST02
  STLA_SIZE determines the size of various objects
  in an ASCII STL file.

  Object sizes for STLA file "cube.stla":

  Solids =                   1
  Nodes (may be repeated) =  36
  Faces (triangular only) =  12

  Number of lines of text =  86

TEST03
  STLA_READ reads an object in an ASCII STL file.

  Object sizes for STLA file "cube.stla":

  Solids =                   1
  Nodes (may be repeated) =  36
  Faces (triangular only) =  12

  Number of lines of text =  86

TEST04
  STLA_WRITE writes an ASCII STL file.

  Graphics data was written to the STLA file "cube_new.stla".

TEST05
  STLA_FACE_NORMAL_COMPUTE computes the face normal
  vectors for an STLA file.

  We have an STLA solid, and its exact normals.
  We now call STLA_FACE_NORMAL_COMPUTE to
  recompute the normals.

  We print out the maximum error, defined as
    |1 - dot ( n1, n2 )|
  where n1 and n2 are the exact and computed normals.

  Maximum error = 0.000000

TEST06
  The MATLAB routine TRIMESH will plot a triangulated surface.
  It can be used to display the object described by an
  ASCII STL file.
